💱 Currency Converter
A simple and interactive currency converter that lets you convert between two different countries' currencies using real-time exchange rates! 🪙✨

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project fetches the latest exchange rates from a currency API and updates country flags dynamically with a flag API 🏳️🌍.

It’s a fun personal learning project where I practiced working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and dynamic UI updates.
